# Recommendation_System_movies
PROJECT OVERVIEW

Jaba Movie Shop endeavors to optimize user engagement and satisfaction through the implementation of a recommendation system. Jaba Movie Shop seeks to leverage on the extensive database of movieLens, to ensure that clients are paired with films that resonate with their preferences. The movies with high ratings are likely to be the mostly watched movies indicating customer satisfaction.


Objective
The objective of this project is build a model that provides the top movie recommendations to a user, based on their ratings of other movies. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, collaborative filtering and content-based filtering the project aims to:

Enhance user engagement by providing a platform where they get best recommendations based on their reviews, tags and ratings.
Build a model that provides the top movie recommendations to a user.
Enhance customer satisfaction.

The above distribution is a gaussian distribution.It is symmetrical about the mean and is rightly skewed. There’s a gradual increase from 1900 to 1980, a significant rise from 1980 to 2010, and a decline after 2010The long tail on the right suggests that there are a few years with exceptionally high movie production as seen in year 2000.

The box plot above is a summary of ratings. It shows that most ratings are between 3 and 4, and there are a few very low ratings (1), which are unusual or “outliers”. The people simply gave ratings from okay to good.

The graph shows a distribution of ratings. It tells us that the data is not centered around a single value. The peaks at ratings 1, 2, 4, and 5 suggest that these ratings are the most common or frequent. The areas where the graph is low indicate ratings that are less common.

The scatter plot shows the distribution of movies based on their popularity and average ratings. Movies with a higher number of ratings are more popular. The concentration of points indicates that movies with an average rating between 3 and 4 are the most popular. This could be because these movies are generally well-received by the audience, leading to more people watching and rating them.

The line graph above tracks the average movie rating for each year from 1900 to 2020. The line goes up and down, which means the average rating changes every year. Some years have higher ratings, and some years have lower ratings.
