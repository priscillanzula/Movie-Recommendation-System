Jaba Movie Shop seeks to leverage on the extensive database of movieLens, to ensure that clients are paired with films that resonate with their preferences. The movies with high ratings are likely to be the mostly watched movies indicating customer satisfaction.

Enhance user engagement by providing a platform where they get best recommendations based on their reviews, tags and ratings.
Build a model that provides the top movie recommendations to a user.

The above distribution is a gaussian distribution.It is symmetrical about the mean and is rightly skewed. There’s a gradual increase from 1900 to 1980, a significant rise from 1980 to 2010, and a decline after 2010The long tail on the right suggests that there are a few years with exceptionally high movie production as seen in year 2000.

The box plot above is a summary of ratings. It shows that most ratings are between 3 and 4, and there are a few very low ratings (1), which are unusual or “outliers”. The people simply gave ratings from okay to good.

The graph shows a distribution of ratings. It tells us that the data is not centered around a single value. The peaks at ratings 1, 2, 4, and 5 suggest that these ratings are the most common or frequent. The areas where the graph is low indicate ratings that are less common.
