The above distribution is a gaussian distribution.It is symmetrical about the mean and is rightly skewed. Thereâ€™s a gradual increase from 1900 to 1980, a significant rise from 1980 to 2010, and a decline after 2010The long tail on the right suggests that there are a few years with exceptionally high movie production as seen in year 2000.
